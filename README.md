# Space-Odyssey-Bubble-Edition
A Single-Player Bubble Shooter game with a splash of space theme made with C++ and SFML (2.6.2). 

## Objective of the Player
- Match 3 (or more) bubbles of the same color. Poof. Score goes up. Good job!
- But miss too many shots in a row (specifically 5), and a brand new row of bubbles is created from space, crowding the top.
- And when those sneaky bubbles hit the bottom? Game over.
- But if you finish all the bubble you are crowned the Victor with your score ready to be displayed on the High Score menu.

## Features & Funcion
- A start screen where you can begin fresh, load a game, peek at high scores, tinker with settings, or just rage-quit.
- An in-game pause menu—because sometimes real life interrupts space missions.
- Background music (a little groovy, I hope), plus sound effects when bubbles launch, bounce, or pop into oblivion.

## Controls
It's dead simple:
- Point the mouse
- Left Click
- Bubble goes zoom
